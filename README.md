# What is MinIO Client?

> MinIO Client is a Golang CLI tool that offers alternatives for ls, cp, mkdir, diff, and rsync commands for filesystems and object storage systems.

# TL;DR;

```console
$ docker run --name minio-client bitnami/minio-client:latest
```

## Docker Compose

```console
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-minio-client/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
```

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DTC)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami MinIO Client Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/minio-client).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/minio-client:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/minio-client/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/minio-client:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/minio-client:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-minio-client.git#master:2020/debian-10'
```

# Connecting to other containers

Using [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), a MinIO Client can be used to access other running containers such as [MinIO server](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-minio).

Containers attached to the same network can communicate with each other using the container name as the hostname.

## Using the Command Line

In this example, we will create a MinIO Client container that will connect to a MinIO server container that is running on the same docker network.

### Step 1: Create a network

```console
$ docker network create app-tier --driver bridge
```

### Step 2: Launch the MinIO server container

Use the `--network app-tier` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the MinIO container to the `app-tier` network.

```console
$ docker run -d --name minio-server \
    --env MINIO_ACCESS_KEY="minio-access-key" \
    --env MINIO_SECRET_KEY="minio-secret-key" \
    --network app-tier \
    bitnami/minio:latest
```

### Step 3: Launch your MinIO Client container

Finally we create a new container instance to launch the MinIO client and connect to the server created in the previous step. In this example, we create a new bucket in the MinIO storage server:

```console
$ docker run --rm --name minio-client \
    --env MINIO_SERVER_HOST="minio" \
    --env MINIO_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY="minio-access-key" \
    --env MINIO_SERVER_SECRET_KEY="minio-secret-key" \
    --network app-tier \
    bitnami/minio-client \
    mb minio/my-bucket
```

# Configuration

MinIO Client (`mc`) can be setup so it is already configured to point to a specific MinIO server by providing the environment variables below:

- `MINIO_SERVER_HOST`: MinIO server host.
- `MINIO_SERVER_PORT_NUMBER`: MinIO server port. Default: `9000`.
- `MINIO_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY`: MinIO server Access Key. Must be common on every node.
- `MINIO_SERVER_SECRET_KEY`: MinIO server Secret Key. Must be common on every node.

For instance, use the command below to create a new bucket in the MinIO Server `my.minio.domain`:

```console
$ docker run --rm --name minio-client \
    --env MINIO_SERVER_HOST="my.minio.domain" \
    --env MINIO_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY="minio-access-key" \
    --env MINIO_SERVER_SECRET_KEY="minio-secret-key" \
    bitnami/minio-client \
    mb minio/my-bucket
```
